        <p>The ancient city of Nippur was a vibrant and ethnically diverse polis populated by Babylonians and Non-Babylonians alike. <br> <br>
        We set out to learn how religious Babylonians were in comparison to their non-Babylonian neighbors. <span class="arrow"> &#9654</span></p>

        <div class="content">
          <p> Traditionally, scholars have turned to priestly and regal texts to learn about a civilization. <br> <br>
          However, these texts can only reveal how the elite groups practiced their relgions and shed little light on the practices and beliefs of the commoners.
          <br> <br>
          What information could there be that may uncover the religious participation of regular folk? <br> <br>
          And, how much did such potential religious participation have to do with ethnicity?
        <span class="arrow"> &#9654</span></p></div>
        <div class="content">
          <p> In order to gain access to non-elite social circles, we combined information from two types of texts: <br> <br>
          common texts recording the transactions of middle class people;<br> <br>
          and a religious text known today as the <strong>Babylonian Almanac</strong>, which notes for each day of the calendar year whether it is positive/lucky or not.
          <br> <br>
          <p>Our expectation was that Babylonians would proscribe to the <strong>Babylonian Almanac</strong> and would avoid doing business on negative days, while targeting positive days for their transactions. <br> <br>
          On the other hand, the transactions of non-Babylonians would be evenly distributed on both positive and negative days.<span class="arrow"> &#9654</span></p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>
          We identified 2,400 individuals from 800 texts, pulled from either the Murasu or Yahudu archives.<br> <br>
          We then determined their ethnicity as either Babylonian, Aramean, Iranian or Judean. 
          <br> <br>
          Finally, we established whether they tended towards conducting transactions on positive ("good luck") or negative("bad luck") days.

        <div class="content">
        <p>
          In this visualization, each individual is represeted by a bubble. The size of the bubble is determined by the number of transactions the individual conducted in our corpus of texts. 
          <br> <br>
          Color of the circle represents the individuals tendency towards either conducting transactions on negative or positive days. <br> <br>
