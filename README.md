##Common Babylonian Religious Praxis 
###A statistical comparisons of religious theory and practice

###Introduction
The ancient city of Nippur was a vibrant and ethnically diverse polis populated by Babylonians and Non-Babylonians alike.  
We set out to learn to what degree did Non-Babylonians differ from Babylonians in their religious observance.

Traditionally, scholars have turned to priestly and regal texts to learn about a civilization.  
However, these texts can only reveal how the elite groups practiced their relgions and shed little light on the practices and beliefs of the commoners.

What information could there be that may uncover the religious participation of regular folk?  
And, how much did such potential religious participation have to do with ethnicity?

In order to gain access to non-elite social circles, we combined information from two types of texts:  
common texts recording the transactions of middle class people; 
and a religious text known today as the Babylonian Almanac, which notes for each day of the calendar year whether it is positive/lucky or not.

Our expectation was that Babylonians would proscribe to the Babylonian Almanac and would avoid doing business on negative days, while targeting positive days for their transactions.  
On the other hand, the transactions of non-Babylonians would be evenly distributed on both positive and negative days.

We collected 2,400 individualss from 800 texts, tagged whether they conducted a transaction on a positive ("good luck") or negative("bad luck") day. Finally, we analyzed whether there was any difference in adherence to the Babylonian Almanac based on ethnicity or other factors.


In this visualization, each individual that conducted a transaction is represeted by a bubble. The size of the bubble reflects how many transactions that individual has conducted in our texts.
The color of the bubble indicates their tendency to conduct transactions on positive or negative days - blue bubbles are people who only conduct transactions on positive, while red are those who are fearless and conduct their business only negative. In between colors (green, yellow, orange) reflect individuals who are a bit more neutral. Noticeably, these individuals also conducted many more transactions. 

Finally, you can group the bubbles by ethnicity.
